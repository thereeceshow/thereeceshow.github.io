### Chronicling an Awesome Coding Journey


**Day 1**

There is a lot to learn.

- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] CLI/Terminal/Bash/Zsh
- [x] Bash does **NOT** care that Get sounds the same as Git
- [x] It also case sensitive... *$ git add -a* and *$ git add -A* are not the same.  

### Here are something I have learned so far though.

1. *The Cliffs of Confusion might be a National Park with many cliffs.*

1. Git makes more sense when I actually do it.
1. Its probably best is we don't let the *designers* see these pages yet.

### How to do a collapsable list with MD:

<details> 
<summary> Use this code </summary>

# `# "Whatever heading you want here"`

`<details>`

`<summary> Click this to Expand the List </summary>`

*`Put your list items here`*

`1. One`

`1. Two`

`1. Thirteenteen`

`1. Shfifty-Five`

`</details>`

These tags look more like traditional HTML tags than what we have been using in MD so far.

### *Here is something I learned,  and I am testing:*

* On my old device (Macbook Pro) my directory containing everything in here was backed up to iCloud.
* When I added my Desktop and Documents to be connected to my iCloud on the new device, all the exisiting folders and files showed up.
* When I ran newcomputer % ls -a on the new device, the .git file was there.
* Now I am making these changes we see right now to see if I can push it up the GitHub.  I will update:
* Note:  Any changes I make to the files on either device will change on the other device too, iCloud will sync the most current version of each one.  I may have to experiment and see what happens if I open both at the same time and make different changes.  I imagine it'll be whichever is saved last.
* There is another intresteing thing I'm curious about right now... but as a security issue... I'm not sure I should publish it on the interwebs.  I'll talk about it on our standup.

### Test 2
