### Chronicling an Awesome Coding Journey


**Day 1**

- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] CLI/Terminal/Bash/Zsh
- [x] Bash does **NOT** care that Get sounds the same as Git

### Here are something I have learned so far though.

1. *The Cliffs of Confusion might be a National Park with many cliffs.*
